# Wasteland Mod - 1.12.2
The classic Minecraft Wasteland mod reborn for 1.12.2

# Downloads
Downloads for the mod can be found Curse: Soon(tm)

# Mist Support
Just for the fun of it, and to spruce up the mod a bit, i have added an optional dependency to Mist Core, if Mist Core is available when running the
mod a special Mist biome has the chance of spawning along with the normal biomes added by the mod.

# TODO - Sort of...
I don't plan on making too many big changes, the mod is good enough as it is, my goal is to keep the mod up to date without switching maintainer with every single update. Any additions i add will be minor Quality of Life improvements.

* Upgrade the config to support the Forge in-game config system.
* Add more day mobs, like a Daylight Skeleton to live alongside the Daylight Zombies.

# License
[LICENSE](LICENSE.MD)

So here's the deal, i never made this mod, i simply updated it from 1.10.2 to 1.12.2. Thus the license on the mod has been carried from
the original version of the mod, i'm not really a fan of the license and would much rather use a more permissive license like MIT or GPL3. 
But that decision is not for me to make unfortunatley. Here's a rundown of what the current license allows you to do:

* You **can** use the mod in modpacks.
* You **cannot** redistribute the mod outside of the official download locations for the mod.
* You **can** decompile the mod and make modifications to the src code for private use or learn from it.

If you're unsure of what you can and can't do after reading this and the license itself, feel free to ask me directly, and i'll be happy
to help.
